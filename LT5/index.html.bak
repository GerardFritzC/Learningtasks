			<h1> Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin </h1>
			<div class="team_img">
			<img src="images/joseph.jpg" alt="team_member_image">
			</div>
			<p> Joseph Stalin was a Soviet politician, general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and premier of the Soviet Union. Initially governing the country as part of a collective leadership, he consolidated power to become dictator by the 1930s. 
			Ideologically adhering to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, he formalised these ideas as Marxism–Leninism, while his own policies are called Stalinism.
			Born to a poor family in Gori in the Russian Empire (now Georgia), Stalin attended the Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary before joining the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He edited the party's newspaper, Pravda, and raised funds for Vladimir Lenin's Bolshevik faction via robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets. 
			Repeatedly arrested, he underwent several internal exiles.<br>
			<br>
			Stalin promoted Marxism–Leninism abroad through the Communist International and supported European anti-fascist movements during the 1930s, particularly in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, his regime signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany, resulting in the Soviet invasion of Poland. 
			Germany ended the pact by invading the Soviet Union in 1941. Joseph Stalin played a crucial role in the Second World War, he is one of the best leaders of the Soviet Union who led the USSR to serveral victories against Nazi Germany.
			Despite initial setbacks, Joseph Stalin led the Soviet Red Army, repelled the German invasion and captured Berlin in 1945, ending World War II in Europe.
			Joseph Stalin governed the Soviet Union from 1922 until his death in 1953 because of cerebral hemorrhage. <br>

			<h1> Franklin Delano Roosevelt </h1>
			<div class="team_img">
			<img src="images/roosevelt.jpg" alt="team_member_image">
			</div>
			<p> Franklin D. Roosevelt, often referred to by his initials FDR, was a U.S. American politician, he was the 32nd president of the United States. 
			As a member of the Democratic Party, he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century.	 
			Franklin D. Roosevelt was born into the Roosevelt family in Hyde Park, New York, he graduated from both Groton School and Harvard College, and attended Columbia Law School, which he left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City. 
			In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt. They had six children, of whom five survived into adulthood. <br>
			<br>
			By 1939 another World War was on the horizon which prompted the United States to respond by passing a series of laws affirming neutrality and rejecting intervention. 
			Despite this, President Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China, the United Kingdom, and eventually the Soviet Union. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, an event he called "a date which will live in infamy", Roosevelt obtained a congressional declaration of war against Japan. 
			On December 11 Japan's allies, Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy declared war on the United States. 
			In response, the US formally joined the Allies and entered the European theater of war. Franklin D. Roosevelt worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allied Powers against the Axis Powers.
			His administration oversaw the construction of The Pentagon, initiated the development of the world's first atomic bomb, and worked with other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions. 
			It was under his wartime leadership that the United States became a superpower on the world stage. <br>

			<h1> Adolf Hitler </h1>
			<div class="team_img">
			<img src="images/hitler.jpg" alt="team_member_image">
			</div>
			<p> Adolf Hitler is a German Politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until his death in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then assuming the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934.
			During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.
			Hitler was born in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party, the precursor of the Nazi Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. 
			In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ("My Struggle"). After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. 
			He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy. <br>
			<br>
			On September 1, 1939, German armed forces invaded Poland and henceforth Hitler’s main energies were devoted to the conduct of a war he had unleashed to dominate Europe and secure Germany’s "living space."
			The first phase of World War II was dominated by German Blitzkrieg tactics: sudden shock attacks against airfields, communications, military installations, using fast mobile armor and infantry to follow up on the first wave of bomber and fighter aircraft. Poland was overrun in less than one month, Denmark and Norway in two months, Holland, Belgium, Luxemburg and France in six weeks. 
			After the fall of France in June 1940 only Great Britain stood firm.
			In a few years the Allies were united against the Axis Powers, in a few years the Axis Powers suffered several defeats from the Allies until they drove the Nazis back to Germany
			As Soviet forces approached Berlin in late April 1945, Hitler began to contemplate suicide. On April 28, Mussolini had been shot by a firing squad and then hung by his feet in a public square in Milan, Italy. 
			Fearing the same fate, Hitler tested cyanide pills he received from the SS on his Alsatian dog Blondi.
			The following day Hitler committed suicide. His body was carried into the garden of the Reich Chancellery by aides, covered with petrol and burned along with his new wife Eva Braun. 
			This final, macabre act of self-destruction appropriately symbolized the career of a political leader whose main legacy to Europe was the ruin of its civilization and the senseless sacrifice of human life for the sake of power and his own commitment to the bestial nonsense of National Socialist race mythology. <br>

			<h1> Emperor Showa </h1>
			<div class="team_img">
			<img src="images/hirohito.jpg" alt="team_member_image">
			</div>
			<p> Emperor Showa is commonly known by his personal name Hirohito, he was the 124th emperor of Japan, ruling from 1926 until his death in 1989. 
			Hirohito and his wife, Empress Kōjun, had two sons and five daughters, he was succeeded by his fifth child and eldest son, Akihito.
			By 1979, Emperor Showa was the only monarch in the world with the title "emperor". He was the longest-lived and longest-reigning historical Japanese emperor and one of the longest-reigning monarchs in the world.
			At the start of his reign, the Empire of Japan was already one of the great powers, the ninth largest economy in the world, the third-largest naval power, and one of the four permanent members of the council of the League of Nations. 
			He was the head of state under the Meiji Constitution during Japan's imperial expansion, militarization, and involvement in World War II. <br>
			<br>
			On 25 December 1926, Hirohito assumed the throne upon the death of his father, Yoshihito. The Crown Prince was said to have received the succession. The Taisho era's end and the Shōwa era's beginning (Enlightened Peace) were proclaimed. The deceased Emperor was posthumously renamed Emperor Taisho within days.
			The first part of Hirohito's reign took place against a background of financial crisis and increasing military power within the government through both legal and extralegal means.
			In July 1939, the Emperor quarrelled with his brother, Prince Chichibu, over whether to support the Anti-Comintern Pact, and reprimanded the army minister, Seishiro Itagaki. 
			But after the success of the Wehrmacht in Europe, the Emperor consented to the alliance. On 27 September 1940, ostensibly under Hirohito's leadership, Japan became a contracting partner of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy forming the Axis Powers.
			After suffering several devastating defeats, in early 1945, in the wake of the losses in the Battle of Leyte, Emperor Hirohito began a series of individual meetings with senior government officials to consider the progress of the war. 
			All but ex-Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe advised continuing the war. Konoe feared a communist revolution even more than defeat in war and urged a negotiated surrender. In February 1945, during the first private audience with the Emperor he had been allowed in three years, Konoe advised Hirohito to begin negotiations to end the war. <br>

			<h1> Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini </h1>
			<div class="team_img">
			<img src="images/mussolini.jpg" alt="team_member_image">
			</div>
			<p> Benito Mussolini was an Italian political leader who became the fascist dictator of Italy from 1925 to 1945. 
			Originally a revolutionary socialist, he forged the paramilitary fascist movement in 1919 and became prime minister in 1922.
			Mussolini was born on July 29, 1883, in Verano di Costa, Italy, Mussolini was the son of blacksmith and ardent socialist Alessandro Mussolini and a devout Catholic mother, Rosa Maltoni. By most accounts, Mussolini’s family lived in simple, small quarters.
			Mussolini was expelled from his first boarding school at age 10 for stabbing a fellow student. At 14, he stabbed another student but was only suspended.
			Much of Mussolini's early adulthood was spent traveling around Switzerland, getting involved with that country's Socialist Party and clashing with police.<br>
			<br>
			At the start of the Second World War, on 10 June 1940, Mussolini decided to enter the war on the Axis side. Despite initial success, the subsequent Axis collapse on multiple fronts and eventual Allied invasion of Sicily made Mussolini lose the support of the population and members of the Fascist Party. 
			As a consequence, early on 25 July 1943, the Grand Council of Fascism passed a motion of no confidence in Mussolini. After thousands of armed Fascists siezed Rome, Mussolini became Prime Minister, as well as Minister of the Interior and Minister for Foreign Affairs.
			After Germany’s invasion of Denmark and Norway, it convinced Mussolini that Hitler would win the war. Soon Holland and Belgium also fell to Hitler. On May 22, 1939, Italy and Germany signed the “Pact of Steel” officially creating the Axis powers. In the years that have past the Allies are slowly winning the Second World War following the death of Mussolini.
			There are conflicting stories about how Mussolini died, but autopsy reports state the dictator was executed by firing squad on April 28, 1945, shot by soldiers firing several bullets-with four of them near the heart causing immediate death.
			The bodies of both Mussolini and Petacci were hung upside down at the Piazzale Loreto in Milan and displayed for crowds to kick and spit on. One day later, Hitler committed suicide and the following week, Germany surrendered.<br>

			<h2> <b>Facts About Winston Churchill </b></h2>
			<p>
				<b>1. He Planned Everything</b><br>
				<br>
				Churchill actually had a rather profound speech impediment. It would often creep up on him if he was in an unplanned situation. 
				To avoid this from happening publicly, he would plan for an event weeks in advance and study every possible social outcome that would happen.
			<span id="dots">....</span>
			<div id="more"> 
				<p> 
					<b>2. Don’t Take His Cigar</b><br>
					<br>
					One of the most famous images of Churchill was taken by photographer Yousef Karsh. In the image, Churchill looks a little angry, a bit grumpy, and has a look in his eyes that says “Don’t mess with me.” 
					To achieve this look, Karsh actually took one of the famous cigars that Churchill would always smoke and then immediately snapped the photograph afterward.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. The Definition of Terror</b><br>
					<br>
					Churchill said that he’d never go down without a fight. This was proven when he had a lifeboat outfitted with a machine gun so that if he had to be set adrift, he could still potentially take some of the enemy down with him. 
					This attitude would also be highly questioned when he pursued an alliance with the Soviet Union, ultimately agreeing to cover up the massacre by the Soviets of 20,000 Polish citizens and to label the International Red Cross as terrorists because of the investigation that there conducting regarding the incident.

			<h2> Facts About Joseph Stalin </h2>
			<p>
				<b>1. His mother sent him to study to become a priest</b><br>
				<br>
				In December 1895, Stalin’s mother sent him to a seminary in the Georgian capital of Tiflis (modern-day Tbilisi). 
				He rebelled against studying scripture, however, instead reading the writings of Karl Marx and joining a local socialist group. 
				Eventually he became an atheist, and in 1899 was expelled from the seminary for failing to attend exams.
			<span id="dots2">....</span>
			<div id="more2"> 
				<p> 
					<b>2. He developed his own brand of Marxism</b><br>
					<br>
					Like Lenin before him, Stalin also had his own interpretation of Marxism. 
					In Stalin’s case this interpretation was very nationalistic and focused on building up the Soviet Union rather than on global revolution.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. His eldest child died in a Nazi concentration camp</b><br>
					<br>
					Stalin’s son from his first marriage, Yakov, was a soldier in the Red Army during World War Two and was either captured or surrendered in the initial stages of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. 
					The Nazis proposed to free him in a prisoner swap but Stalin refused, possibly because he believed that Yakov had surrendered voluntarily. 
					He died in Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1943.

					<b>3. FDR was almost assassinated.</b><br>
					<br>
					During a Miami rally held on February 15, 1933 less than a month before Roosevelt's first term began—former bricklayer Giuseppe Zangara fired at FDR with a cheap revolver. "I like Roosevelt personally, but I don't like presidents," he claimed. 
					Zangara shot five people attending the event, including Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, before he was subdued. He missed Roosevelt entirely.

			<h2> Facts About Adolf Hitler </h2>
			<p>
				<b>1. He was a frustrated artist </b><br>
				<br>
				It’s tempting to wonder how different the 20th century might have been had Hitler’s youthful aspirations to become an artist been realised.
				He twice failed the entrance exam of the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna (in 1907 and in 1908) when it was noted that, though he had some talent for architectural draughtsmanship, his human figures lacked detail and character.

			<div id="more4"> 
				<p> 
					<b>2. He once lived in a homeless shelter </b><br>
					<br>
					Hitler’s failure to make it as an artist had grave financial consequences.
					Having had little success selling his paintings, postcards and advertisements, his financial resources were so seriously diminished that he lived in a homeless shelter in Vienna in December 1909.
					He then lived in a public dormitory for men until 1913, when he received his father’s inheritance and moved to Munich.  
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. He was wounded in the First World War </b><br>
					<br>
					Whilst still an Austrian citizen, Adolf Hitler was accepted into the Bavarian army. 
					He served in the infantry at the First Battle of Ypres, where the new infantry divisions suffered casualties as high as one third to a half.
