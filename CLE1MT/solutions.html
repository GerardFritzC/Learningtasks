					<h1> Solutions for HIV/AIDS </h1>
					<p> As mentioned, many causes of the wild spread are surfacing and people are getting infected day by day. 
					Scientists are busy trying to find a cure but to no vail. There are treatments which can make infected people feel stronger but there is no real cure.
					So how can we protect ourselves from this harmful and deadly disease? <br>
					<br>
					If you have HIV, there are many actions you can take to prevent transmitting HIV to others. 
					Firstly, you can protect yourself by having abstinence (not having sex) or even if you engage in an intercourse you can protect yourself by choosing sex that is less risky than anal or vaginal sex because you cannot get HIV from sexual activities that do not involve contact with body fluids (semen, vaginal fluid, or blood).
					You can also protect yourself by using condoms during an intercourse because condoms are highly effective in preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), like gonorrhea and chlamydia.
					You can also prevent the spread of HIV from injection drug use by not sharing needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment.
					If ever you are an HIV-positive and you happen to be pregnant, you can prevent transmitting HIV to your baby by being diagnosed and treated, the more effectively HIV medicine will prevent transmission to your baby.
					And lastly, the most important and the most effective way of preventing HIV/AIDS is through education, by educating many people, it would lessen the spread of HIV because people would know what to avoid, what to do, and what not to do, in order to prevent them from getting HIV. <br>
					<br></p>
					
					<h3>We must keep in mind that HIV has no real cure, which is why prevention is better than cure. <br> </h3>
