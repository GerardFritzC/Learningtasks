					<h2>HIV</h2>
					<p> HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that weakens a person’s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. 
					There is currently no effective cure for HIV, which is why it is one of the most biggest social issue in the Philippines.<br>
					<br>
					HIV can be transmitted through certain body fluids, such as blood, semen and pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk.
					For transmission to occur, the HIV in these fluids must get into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through a mucous membrane which can be found in the rectum, vagina, mouth, or tip of the penis, open cuts or sores, or by direct injection.
					People with HIV who take HIV medicine daily as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partners.<br>
					<br>
					In 2019 alone, an estimated 97,000 people were living with HIV in the Philippines and more cases are still occuring each day since then.
					The prevalence rate of HIV in the Philippines among adults ages 15 to 49 was 0.2% in 2019. <br>
					<br>
					The groups most affected by the HIV epidemic in the Philippines often face social stigma, isolation and legally sanctioned discrimination. 
					These populations include people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers and transgender people.
					HIV has claimed many lives of our fellow Filipinos since the first HIV case in 1984. </p>

					<h2>AIDS</h2>
					<p> AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.) is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. <br>
					<br>
					If you have HIV and you are not on HIV treatment, eventually your body’s immune system will weaken and you will progress to AIDS 
					are caused by the deterioration of the immune system and the decline of CD4+ T cells, which are the immune system's key infection fighters. 
					As soon as HIV enters the body, it begins to destroy these cells. Some common symptoms include dry cough, pneumonia, rapid weight loss, profound, unexplained fatigue, diarrhea that lasts for more than a week, recurring fever or profuse night sweats, white spots or unusual blemishes on the tongue, in the mouth, or in the throat, and red, brown, pink or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose or eyelids.<br>
					<br>
					Being HIV-positive, or having HIV disease, is not the same as having AIDS. 
					Many people are HIV-positive but don’t get sick for many years.				
					As HIV disease continues, it slowly wears down the immune system. 
					Viruses, parasites, fungi and bacteria that usually don’t cause any problems can make you very sick if your immune system is damaged.</p>
