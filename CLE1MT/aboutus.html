						<h2> HIV/AIDS Health Organization </h2>
						<p> Over the last three decades, governments and public health organizations have made tremendous progress in containing the epidemic and enabling people diagnosed with HIV to manage their illness.
							It is our duty to help accelerate the end of AIDS, tuberculosis, and other diseases caused by HIV. 
							As much as possible, we need to lessen or prevent more people from being infected with HIV because there is still no cure for this virus. <br>
							<br>
							We gathered these information about HIV and AIDS because in the fight against HIV/AIDS, knowledge is power.
							Education campaigns enable individuals to learn the consequences of HIV/AIDS, find out how the viruses spread and discover ways to protect themselves against contracting the virus.
							Knowledge empowers people who have already been diagnosed with HIV to improve their quality of life by seeking treatment and learning how to manage their illness. 
							Community education also combats toxic stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV.
