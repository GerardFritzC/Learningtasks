					<h3> Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) </h3>
					<p>CVD is a class of diseases that involve the heart or blood vessels.
					CVD includes coronary artery diseases (CAD) such as angina and myocardial infarction (commonly known as a heart attack).
					Other CVDs include stroke, heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, abnormal heart rhythms, and congenital heart disease.

					<h3> Chlamydia </h3>
					<p> Chlamydia is an STD caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. It can cause cervicitis, urethritis, and proctitis. 
					But it can be easily cured with antibiotic medicine. 
					It’s one of the most common STDs, and most people who have chlamydia don’t show any symptoms.

					<h3> Pubic Lice (Crabs) </h3>
					<p> Pubic lice are tiny insects found in your genital area. They are a different type of louse from head lice and body lice. 
					Measuring 1/16 inch (1.6 millimeters) or less, pubic lice received their nickname because their bodies resemble tiny crabs. 
					Pubic lice feed on your blood, and their bites can cause severe itching. Treatment includes applying over-the-counter creams and lotions that kill the parasites and their eggs.

					<h3> Chronic Diarrhea </h3>
					<p> Chronic diarrhea is a common problem for people living with HIV, with as many as 60% experiencing three or more loose or watery bowel movements per day.
					For people living with HIV, chronic diarrhea can impede the absorption of certain antiretroviral drugs, contributing to suboptimal viral control and, in some cases, the premature development of drug resistance.

					<h3> Hepatitis </h3>
					<p> If you are HIV-positive, you’re more likely to also have the viral liver infection hepatitis than people who don’t have HIV. You’re also more likely to get hepatitis in the future. 
					That is because HIV and the two most serious types of hepatitis can spread the same way, including through sex without a condom or by sharing needles used for drugs.
					Hepatitis is inflammation of your liver. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. Both HIV and hepatitis B spread through blood, semen, mucus, and other body fluids. Hepatitis C is transmitted through blood.

					<h3> Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) </h3>
					<p> People living with HIV, having longer life expectancy, now face several age-related conditions as well as side effects of long-term exposure of Antiretroviral therapy. 
					Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common comorbidity in this population. 
					CKD is a relentlessly progressive disease that may evolve toward end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and significantly affect quality of life and risk of death.

					<h3> Molluscum Contagiosum </h3>
					<p> Molluscum contagiosum, sometimes called water warts, is a viral infection of the skin that results in small raised pink lesions with a dimple in the center. 
					They may become itchy or sore, and occur singularly or in groups. 
					Molluscum contagiosum is an STD that can be transmitted by having intercourse especially with a HIV-positive person.

					<h3> Pneumonia </h3>
					<p> Pneumonia occurs commonly in HIV-infected patients, pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. 
					Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. People living with HIV are more vulnerable to pneumonias of all kinds because they have a weakened immune system. 
					Certain pneumonias lead to an AIDS diagnosis, such as Pneumocystis, recurrent pneumonia (more than once in a year's time), and active tuberculosis.

					<h3> Tuberculosis (TB) </h3>
					<p> Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. 
					Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. 
					Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis.
					Tuberculosis is a serious health threat, especially for people living with HIV. 
				    Tuberculosis is one of the leading causes of death among people living with HIV worldwide.

					<h3> Vaginal Candidiasis </h3>
					<p> Candidiasis, commonly called thrush, is a fungal infection caused by strains of Candida, a type of yeast. 
					Candida normally lives inside the body (in places such as the mouth, throat, gut, and vagina) and on skin without causing any problems. 
					Sometimes Candida can multiply and cause an infection if the environment inside the vagina changes in a way that encourages its growth.
					People living with HIV infection are more prone to candidiasis especially in the vagina, if the patient engaged in a vaginal intercourse. 
					It is not an uncommon condition and generally manifests when a person's immune response is low.
