				<h3>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
				<p><em> " Where now are the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?
				Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?
				Where is the harp on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?
				Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing?
				They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;
				The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.
				Who shall gather the smoke of the deadwood burning,
				Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning? "</em><br></p>

				<h3>Titanic</h3>
				<p><em> “Well, yes, ma’am, I do… I mean, I got everything I need right here with me. 
				I got air in my lungs, a few blank sheets of paper. I mean, I love waking up in the morning not knowing what’s gonna happen or, who I’m gonna meet, where I’m gonna wind up. 
				Just the other night I was sleeping under a bridge and now here I am on the grandest ship in the world having champagne with you fine people. 
				I figure life’s a gift and I don’t intend on wasting it. You don’t know what hand you’re gonna get dealt next. You learn to take life as it comes at you — to make each day count.”</em><br></p>

				<h3>Braveheart</h3>
				<p><em> “Fight and you may die. Run, and you’ll live… at least a while.
				And dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willin’ to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they’ll never take… our freedom!”</em> <br></p>
